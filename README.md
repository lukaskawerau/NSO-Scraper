This is my solution for one task on the World Bank Data To Do List: [Scrapers and APIs for reference data](https://github.com/worldbankdata/our-todo-list#scrapers-and-apis-for-reference-data)

Uses `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to extract the links to NSOs.  
Written in Python 3.  

Would also be trivially extendable to pipe this into a SQL database and check for updates.
